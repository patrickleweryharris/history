I've always noticed that whenever lawmakers got together in the good old days; they always had a grand party. I wonder what the world would look like if Metternich had no been a gelous monster (about the Duchess of Sagan's flings at parties) at the Congress of Vienna or if the founding fathers had been sober when making the Constitution or if John A. MacDonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada had not had a handover twenty four hours a day. The world sure would be different; though I wonder...for better or worse?
