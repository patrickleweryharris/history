Wilhelm The First's crowning was only made possible by the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871,&nbsp;asserting&nbsp;the total power of the Prussian dominated North German Confederation. Tied with the economic connectivity of the German States, Germany was ready to become a unified nation. On 18 January 1871, Prussian King Wilhelm was pronounced Kaiser, of the German Empire at the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The French were made to suffer&nbsp;horribly under the terms of the first Treaty of&nbsp;Versailles, giving up Alsace&nbsp;Lorraine&nbsp;and having to pay an indemnity to Prussia which was to the same specifications as the&nbsp;indemnity&nbsp;Prussia had been made to pay Napoleon in 1807. German troops occupied Northern France until this indemnity was paid.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the First World War, France did everything to destroy Germany. The German Empire was&nbsp;officially&nbsp;dissolved at it's birth place, the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. The terms given to Germany in the second Treaty of Versailles were a direct cause of the Second World War. The correlation can be directly scene from the Napoleonic Wars, right up to the Second World War. All &nbsp;of this is because of one nation, a nation that when it asserts its national identity, causes problems. this nation is Germany.<br />
