Part 2! In this part I will cover Nelson from 10 April 1777 to the start of the French Revolutionary Wars (1789). After Nelson had been promoted to Lieutenant he was made 2nd Lieutenant of the frigate <em>HMS Lowestoffe. </em>After his arrival, he distinguished himself to the point that the commandant of the Jamaica station made him commander of the brig <em>HMS Badger.</em>&nbsp; It is also possible that his uncle's influence at the admiralty helped his promotions. However, his uncle died in 1778, so no more help from him was coming. After only two years in his position of Lieutenant/Commander, he was made a Post Captain (1779). He was then sent on an expedition to Nicaragua which though technically successful, was in reality a disaster. The Admiralty however, seeing that Nelson had followed his orders to the utmost, gave him a pat on the back. Nelson was then assigned to the West Indies Station, to stop the newly independent Americans from trading with the British Colonies in the New World. It could be said that he exceeded his orders by impounding some American ships, so the colonists put a price on his head. He was forced to stay onboard his ship until the President of Nevis (John Herbert) stood bail for him. Nelson now spent much of his time at Herbert's estate, Montpelier. During this period he met Fanny Nisbet, a widow with a son. Horatio and Fanny were married on 11 March 1787. After this they moved back to England, were they stayed with Horatio on half-pay, shipless. After the start of the French revolution, Horatio was given command of <em>HMS Agamemnon, </em>with Josiah as a midshipman. The <em>Agamemnon </em>was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, patrolling off the south of France.
