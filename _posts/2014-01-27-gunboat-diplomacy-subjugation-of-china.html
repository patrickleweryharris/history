 &nbsp; &nbsp; During the Nineteenth century, China was a backwater. The Qing dynasty was nearing the end of its long decline. To European Imperialists, particularly the British and French, China was ripe for the picking. The first battle was the one
for trade, which the Europeans had won much earlier, in the Eighteenth century. The forcible opening of China to trade would be the catalyst for a long line of events, culminating in the dissolution of the Empire and the eventual rise of Communism. The
weapon of this catalyst was opium.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Opium was big business for the British, in the form of the East India Company. The company was of the opinion that&nbsp;if the Chinese population became addicted, leading to massive internal
problems for China, it was not the companies problem . This was not the Chinese point of view, so in 1839, China banned the import of opium. Naturally, the East India Company did not take kindly to the Chinese government killing off one of their principal
revenue sources. Though what the Chinese did was the act of a sovereign government within its own territory, the British government felt compelled to intervene when Chinese warships fired upon two British ships that were attempting to help ship opium
into Canton (Guangzhou). A force of warships was dispatched, including the experimental <i>&nbsp;Nemesis</i>.<br /><br /><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nemesis</i>&nbsp;was a gunboat. Commissioned into the service of the East India Company, she was one of the first
of her kind, she had an extremely shallow draft and a flat bottom, allowing her to navigate rivers, harbours and other shallow waters which may be other wise impassible to larger, more traditional, warships. <i>Nemesis</i> was armed with two 32 pounder
and four 6 pounder guns, &nbsp;as well as a congreve rocket launcher. The Chinese had wooden war junks, some of which were not armed with guns, only bows. When <i>Nemesis</i> arrived in China, it was a turkey shoot.<br /><br /><br />

</table>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thus the <i>first</i>&nbsp;Opium War was one of a long series of defeats for China. Each time around, the Chinese were destroyed by superior technology, and forced to sign humiliating peace treaties. This resulted in the opening of China
to European (principally British) and domination (i.e. The French invasion of Indochina and the ceding of Hong Kong to Britain, the latter transgression was only corrected in 1999). The Chinese Empire could not survive like this, and it did not, becoming
a short lived "democracy" before the horrific war with Japan and the rise of Communism.<br />

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The gunboat, first iterated in the <i>Nemesis, </i>would become a symbol of European naval dominance, patrolling the vast lands of Europe's empires in the dying age of imperialism.<br /><br /><br />
