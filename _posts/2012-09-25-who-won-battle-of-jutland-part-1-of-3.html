&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;Post Captain</i> is longer than I remember.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is a German sailor's account of the Battle of Jutland (May 31st 1916). Next week I will feature a British account, and the week after I will create my own account of the Battle Of Jutland. This account is unedited.<br /><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;Account of the Battle of Jutland by a German Sailor on the Lutzow</div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly the entire ship is roughly shaken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The colossus heaves far over, and everything that is not fixed is upset.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; The first direct hit!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The torpedo pierces the fore part of the ship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Its effects are terrible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Iron, wood, metal, parts of bodies, and smashed ships' implements are all intermixed, and the electric light, by chance spared, continues to shine upon this sight.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;Two decks lower, in the diesel dynamo room, there is still life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>That compartment has not been hit, and twenty-seven men, in the prime of life, have been spared, but the chamber is shut off from all others, for the water is rushing into all sections.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;They are doomed to death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Several 38-centimetre shells squarely hit their mark, working terrible havoc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The first hit the wireless department.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Of the twelve living men who a moment ago were seated before the apparatus, there is nothing more to be seen.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing is left but a smoking heap of ruins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The second shot again pierced the fore part of the ship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The entire forepart of the vessel, as far as the diesel motor room, was past saving.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;Another broadside meant for the Lutzow fell short, but a torpedo boat close by disappeared, leaving only a few odd pieces of wood and a smashed lifeboat drifting around.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;It is now half-past 7, and the hostile circle grows ever smaller.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Lutzow and the Seydlitz lie with their bows deep in the water; both are badly mauled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The forepart of the Lutzow was in flames.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Shells burst against the ship's side in rapid succession.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;A terrible sight is presented on board the Lutzow, and it needs iron nerves to look upon it coolly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Hundreds have lost their lives, while many have lain for hours in torture, and the fight is not yet over.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;The bow is now crushed in and is entirely submerged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The four screws are already sticking half out of the water, so that the Lutzow can only make eight to ten knots an hour, as against the normal thirty-two.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Admiral decides to transfer to the Moltke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He gives orders to turn and get away from the scene of the fight, but the Lutzow has not gone a mile before she receives a broadside of 38-centimetre shells.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;The entire ship was filled with the poisonous fumes of the shells, and any one who failed to affix his gas mask was doomed to be suffocated.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was three-quarters of an hour before the lighting installation was restored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then for the first time could the extent of the damage wrought by the salvo be seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One of the shells had landed in the sick bay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Here there were only three doctors and fifteen attendants, besides 160 to 180 wounded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Of all those, only four remained alive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>These four were hurled into the next compartment by the air pressure; there they lay unconscious.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Lutzow was now a complete wreck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Corpses drifted past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>From the bows up to the first 30-centimetere gun turret the ship lay submerged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The other gun turrets were completely disabled, with the guns sticking out in all directions.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;On deck lay the bodies of the sailors in their torn uniforms, in the midst of the empty shell cases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>From the masts fluttered torn flags, twisted signal lines, and pieces of wire of the wireless installation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Had not the lookout man and the three officers on the commander's bridge given signs of life, the Lutzow would have truly resembled a ship of the dead.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;Below, on the battery deck, there still lay innumerable wounded, but there was no longer a doctor to attend to them.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;Night came on and hope was entertained of getting away without a further encounter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But at 3 o'clock in the night news of the approach of two British cruisers and five destroyers was received and just at that critical time the fore and middle bulkheads gave way.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;Orders were given to carry the wounded to the stern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then the order rings out: "All hands muster in division order abaft."<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;A tumult arises on the lower deck, for everybody is now bent on saving his life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is impossible in that short space of time to bring up all the wounded, for they are scattered everywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Eighteen men had the good fortune to be carried up, but all the rest who could not walk or crawl had to be left behind.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;The twenty-seven men shut up in the diesel dynamo chamber had heard the order through the speaking tube, for many, mad with anguish, screamed through the tube for help, and it was learned that two of their number lay bound because they had become insane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Inspired by their sense of duty, these sealed-up men had continued to carry on their work in order to provide the ship with light.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;The torpedo-boats now quickly took off the crew of the Lutzow, and those left behind were doomed to death.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was resolved that no piece of the vessel should fall into the enemy's hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>An order was given and a torpedo cleft the waters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Just then seven men were to be seen running like madmen round the rear deck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Over-fatigued as they were, they had apparently dropped off to sleep and only just awakened.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;As the torpedo exploded, the Lutzow's bow quickly dipped, and the stern rose until she stood on end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then she heeled over and sank, forming a great whirlpool that carried everything within it into the depths.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;When the roll was called it appeared that there were 1,003 survivors of the Lutzow; 597 men had perished in the battle.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Source: Source Records of the Great War, Vol. IV, ed.
