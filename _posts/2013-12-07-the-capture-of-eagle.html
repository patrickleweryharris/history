<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp;During the Napoleonic Wars, regiments of the Imperial French army carried as their standard a gilded eagle upon a staff. The eagle was a sign of prestige, and men would fight like devils for it. It is not surprising then that the eagle was one of the most sought after prizes on the battlefield. The first eagles were captured by the Russians and Prussians during the Austerlitz campaign, but in this post, I will delve into the first British capture of an eagle, that of&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 19.1875px;">Ensign Edward Keogh and&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">Sergeant Patrick Masterson of the 87th Regiment (Royal Irish&nbsp;</span></span><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">Fusiliers) at the Battle of Barrosa in 1811.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The capture of this eagle&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;due to the British repulsing a French attack upon Barrosa ridge. As the column of 3000 men advanced, it suffered horrendous&nbsp;casualties&nbsp;of up to 50% due to British and&nbsp;Portuguese&nbsp;musket and artillery fire. Eventually, two regiments, the British 87th, and the&nbsp;Portuguese&nbsp;20th,&nbsp;charged&nbsp;the broken column, over running the French 8th regiment, which had been attempting to deploy into line. A vicious&nbsp;bayonet&nbsp;fight ensued. Ensign Keogh was the first to grab the eagle from its bearer,&nbsp;though he was&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;shot and killed by&nbsp;ferocious&nbsp;French defenders. The eagle&nbsp;was&nbsp;then grabbed by Sergeant Masterson, who killed the eagle's bearer, managing to escape with the eagle safely. He was later gazetted as an Ensign, eventually reaching the rank of Captain.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;"><br /></span></span><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The 87th was given the Royal title as "Prince of Wales own Irish Regiment", and its regimental badge displayed an eagle.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/images/central-panel/1rir_hist_napwars_410.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="234" src="http://www.army.mod.uk/images/central-panel/1rir_hist_napwars_410.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;"><br /></span><br /><div style="margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px; text-align: center;"><br /></div>
