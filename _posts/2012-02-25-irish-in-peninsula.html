I've always found it funny that when I hear people talk about the British victories in the Peninsular War (and later Waterloo) when I think they should be called Irish victories. The Irish had the best Regiments (such as the Iniskillings, who held the centre of the line at Waterloo). Also,&nbsp;over one third of the men &nbsp;of the so called "English County Regiments" were Irish. The Irish were a despised under-class and I'm sure much of them would rather be killing redcoats than wearing them. But times were tough in Ireland, and they needed to eat. Boys like Patrick Harper couldn't survive as rebels. The Irish were great soldiers, and their sacrifices need to be recognised.
