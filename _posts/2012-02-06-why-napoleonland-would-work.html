Plans have recently been announced for a Napoleon theme park to be built at the site of the Battle   of Monterea (1814) just south of Paris. I think this is&nbsp;great idea, not only to bring alive the history of this sadly unremembered part of history; but also because it gives the French an opportunity to revel in the whimsy of Napoleon's memory.&nbsp; Napoleon created much of this memory, not through battles, but through stretched truth recollections that he made on St. Helena in the six years he lived after Waterloo. This created a memory of glory that is still much believed in France. And heck, he probably deserved it. Napoleon's rule was much smother than any others in France in the time period. He introduced religious freedom and the metric system; and if left in power, the first and second world wars may never have happened, but I'll leave speculation like that to authors like Harry Turtledove, I'm sure it would make a great story. Another reason I love this park idea is that it recollects every point of view, not just Napoleon's. They would even have daily reenactments of the Battle of Waterloo (1815), a battle Napoleon <em>lost. </em>This park would be a true monument to all who lived in this period.
