&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em><u>Reminder: This blog will be inactive from July 8th to August 17th 2012</u></em></strong><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So I leave on July 8th for a training course with the RCN...I would like to tie up a few loose ends before I leave. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; First order of business: I was recently asked by Rear Admiral J.J. Bennet OMM, CD Chief Reserves and Cadets (Canada) why Naval officers wear their swords backwards, instead of frontwards. At the time I had no answer (actually no correct answer), so I have been looking for one ever since. As far as I can tell, Commonwealth Naval Officers wear their swords backwards because of some disgrace.&nbsp;It is speculated that the disgrace was over the mutinies of 1797 or that some Naval officer pulled his sword on an Admiral or a Royal. <br /><br />&nbsp; Second order of business: As I will be away, I will not be able to do my daily "On This Day" tweets. So I have prepared a little selection for you:<br /><br />July 7, 1807: ·Czar Alexander I makes peace with Napoleon&nbsp;with the Treaty of  Tilsit<br /><br />July 22, 1807: ·Napoleon creates the Grand Duchy of Warsaw~Buffer zone between France &amp; Russia<br /><br />July 22 1805: The Battle of Cape&nbsp;Finisterre~Part of the Trafalgar Campaign<br /><br />July 27 1809: The Battle of Talavera~Where Sharpe captured the Eagle (fictional character)<br /><br />August 1, 1798: The Battle of the Nile~Made Nelson&nbsp;(more) famous&nbsp; <br /><br />August 1 1808: Landings at Mondego Bay Portugal commence (British intervention in Spain)<br /><br />August 4, 1802: Napoleon is made First Consul for life~He would later crown himself Emperor<br /><br />August 15, 1769: Napoleon Bonaparte born on Corsica<br /><br />August 17 1808: The Battle of Roliça~One of the&nbsp;first battles of the Peninsular War<br /><br />August 17 1812: The&nbsp;Battle of Smolensk~Part of the Russian Campaign<br /><br />August 20 1808: The Battle of Vimeiro~One of the first battles of the Peninsular War<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><strong>See y'all when I come back!</strong></div><div align="center"><br /></div><div align="center"><br /></div><div align="center"><img height="266" id="il_fi" src="http://www.military-art.com/mall/images/dhm1657.jpg" style="padding-bottom: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px;" width="400" />﻿</div><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />
