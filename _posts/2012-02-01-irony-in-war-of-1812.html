Lately I have been doing some reading on the War of 1812 and I have noticed some irony in who won which battle. It serves as (albeit morbid) comic relief. It seems that the British won most of the land battles and then lost the last one after the war was over (New Orleans). It also seems that the Americans won most of the sea battles but lost the last (USS President capture) also after the war was over. This strange irony made me laugh...but I understand if it doesn't make you laugh. You had to be there.
