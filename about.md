{{ site.title }} is a blog about the age of sail and the age of revolutions, and
the occasional post that bends those topics quite a bit.

Some great books that are frequently used as sources include:
- *Naval Miscellany* by Angus Konstam
- *To War With Wellington* by Peter Snow
- The entire Richard Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell; these books sparked my interest in the Napoleonic Wars and I find myself constantly referencing historical information from these books.
- *Master and Commander* (and its accompanying series) by Patrick O'Brian; which sparked my interest in the naval side of the spectrum.
- *Vienna 1814* by David King
- *History's Greatest Hits* by Joseph Cummins
- *The Mental Floss History of the World* by Eric Sass and Steve Wiegand with Will Pearson and Mangesh Hattikudor
- *Great Battles* General Editor: Christer Jorgensen
- *Horatio Nelson and His Victory* by Philip Reeve
- *Battle At Sea* by R.G Grant
- *The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Warfare* by R.G Grant
- *Breverton's Nautical Curiosities* by Terry Breverton
- *Manual of Seamanship for Boys and Seaman of the Royal Navy, 1904* by Lieutenant Cecil H. Fox, R.N.
